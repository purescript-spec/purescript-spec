## Introduction

*PureScript Spec* is a simple testing framework for Purescript, inspired by
[hspec](http://hspec.github.io/). Use PureScript Spec to write synchronous and
asynchronous tests using a simple DSL, combine with other testing tools, and
generate test output in various formats.

## Installation

Given that you already have a PureScript project setup, the first thing to do
is installing `purescript-spec` as a dependency.

```bash
npx spago install spec
```

[purescript-spec on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-spec)
features version information and API documentation.

The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/purescript-spec/purescript-spec).
